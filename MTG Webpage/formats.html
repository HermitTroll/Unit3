            <p>There are many different game modes you can play, in fact there are 25. That is a lot of rules to learn and is intimidating when you start out, so this goes 
                over the three most common game modes that people play. Things like player number, card total, and card requirements are the most common rule changes between the modes.
            </p>

        <div class="mobile">
            <p>Standard is a 2 player game mode where every player starts out with 20 life. The deck has a 60 card minimum and aside from basic lands, you can have up to 4 of any
                given card. This mode only uses the most recent sets released in the last 5 years.
            </p>

            <p>Modern is also a 2 player game mode that starts players with 20 life. Same as standard you can have up to 4 of any given card aside from lands. In this game mode you are not 
                limited to the most recent decks, instead there is just a list of banned cards.
            </p>

            <p>Commander is a 2+ player game mode where players start with 40 life. Decks feature a commader that sits in the command zone. This commander can be summoned at any 
                time by paying the mana cost. When it is defeated, it returns to the command zone with a 2 colorless mana increase to summon it next time. Decks are built of 100
                cards, no greater or lesser, and every card can only be used once, with the exception of basic lands. This is a timeless so all cards are legal with very few 
                exceptions. The color identity is determined by the commanders color identity.
